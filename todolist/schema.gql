# A todolist entry requires a message (string) and isDone (boolean)
# However, FaunaDB automatically adds two private values: _id and _ts

type ToDoListItem {
  message: String!
  isDone: Boolean!
  # _id: Generated by FaunaDB as each document's unique identifier
  # _ts: Timestamp generated by FaunaDB upon object creation
}

# A query named 'entries' which returns an array of ToDoListItems objects
# Implicit arguments: _size (count) and _cursor (location within the Index)
